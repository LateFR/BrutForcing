This project is a simple brute force password (or string in general) cracker. It does not directly allow passwords to be recovered without prior modification, and was not designed for this purpose. This allows you to understand the ease of programming this hacking rudiment (it took me less than 48 hours to code it), and at the same time its ineffectiveness (test the long string of characters and you will understand).
