# English version (French version below) :

This project is a simple brute force password (or string in general) cracker. It does not directly allow passwords to be recovered without prior modification, and was not designed for this purpose. This allows you to understand the ease of programming this hacking rudiment (it took me less than 48 hours to code it), and at the same time its ineffectiveness (test the long string of characters and you will understand).

> ## The different modes
>
> ### 1-Hardrun
>
> Hardrun mode is the most efficient mode. It will report back to you about the progress after 180 seconds in the console. Other than that, it will stop and report when it finds the password
>
> ### 2-Comfort (2.0)
>
> Comfort mode is slower, but they will give you regular reports based on a time interval that you have defined in the console (such as the number of attempts already made, the estimated time remaining, etc.).
>
> ### 3-Beta(3.0)
>
> Beta mode is still under development. It is normally functional but not very efficient.

>## Notes:
>
>I am French. The code, comments and console messages are therefore in French. Sorry!
>But for the console messages, they are few in number and non-technical, so you can easily translate them with tools like "Google translate".
